The Open E chord is one of the fundamental chords all beginner guitarists should know. It is one example of the open chords, whose patterns reoccur in barre chords later on. Mastering the open chords will help with learning CAGED and playing chords across the fretboard.

In order to play it, place your first (index) finger on string 3, fret 1 (G#). Place your second (middle) finger on string 4, fret 2 (E). Place your third (ring) finger on string 5, fret 2 (B).

There are no muted strings - play all six when you strum.
