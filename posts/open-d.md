The Open D chord is one of the fundamental chords all beginner guitarists should know. It is a prime example of the open chords, which are integral as their patterns reoccur in barre chords later on. Mastering the open chords will facilitate learning CAGED and playing chords seamlessly across the fretboard.

In order to play it, place your first (index) finger on string 2, fret 2 (E). Place your second (middle) finger on string 0, fret 2 (A). Place your third (ring) finger on string 1, fret 3 (D).

There are two muted strings in this chord: string 5 and string 6. When you strum, play from string 4 (D) downwards.
