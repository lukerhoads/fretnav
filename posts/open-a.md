The Open A chord is one of the essential chords every budding guitarist should master. Like other open chords, it forms the foundation for many other chords, especially those in the CAGED system, which helps guitarists play chords all over the fretboard.

To play the Open A chord, place your first (index) finger on string 3, fret 2 (C#). Place your second (middle) finger on string 2, fret 2 (A). Place your third (ring) finger on string 1, fret 2 (E).

For the Open A chord, only strum the bottom five strings; do not strum the thickest string (low E string).
